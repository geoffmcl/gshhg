# GSHHG Project

For the original source data see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/pwessel/gshhg/">here</a>.

For another project related to flight planning I needed to be able to extract 
a bounding box of the shoreline, and so this small project was born.

The final executable is gshhg.exe

But then the porject expanded, exploring and testing reading/writing various image files.
